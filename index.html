  <h3>Company Expense Tracker</h3>

  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
  <p>Manual tracking of expenses from PDF and image-based receipts is labour-intensive, prone to errors, and lacks consistency for finance review. 
    There are often delays before expenses can be filed, and data entry typically requires access to a computer.</p>

  <h4>Solution</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatically extract and standardise data from uploaded PDF/image receipts using OCR and classification using Telegram.</li>
    <li>Categorise expenses by type, department, and employee based on predefined business rules.</li>
    <li>Generate a consolidated report highlighting anomalies or missing data for finance team validation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Process</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Employees upload receipts/invoices via a <strong>Telegram chatbot</strong>, 
    which triggers OCR to extract key fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extracted data is saved in a 
    <strong>secure company Google Sheets</strong> document for finance tracking.
  </li>
  <li>
    The system sends milestone updates to employees and forwards the expense 
    report to <strong>Finance via email</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finance reviews the report and submits an approval or rejection decision 
    through email.
  </li>
  <li>
    The decision is recorded in the tracker, and the employee is notified via 
    <strong>Telegram and email</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h4>Key Outcomes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Over 70% reduction in manual data entry time for expense processing.</li>
    <li>Improved accuracy and consistency in expense categorisation and reporting.</li>
    <li>Quicker month-end close and enhanced audit readiness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Semiconductor Nonconformance Monitoring</h3>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>
  In semiconductor manufacturing, nonconformance tracking for equipment issues such as glass breakage is often fragmented across MES, specialist tools, and ERP systems, 
  resulting in delayed responses, poor visibility for quality teams, and inconsistent follow-through on corrective actions.
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Automate severity classification of equipment errors using predefined business rules (e.g. low, high, critical).</li>
  <li>Automatically notify quality leads of high-risk cases and escalate critical events to corrective action agents via email.</li>
  <li>Log all events, escalations, and resolutions in a centralised database to enable consistent tracking and reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Process</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The system detects a nonconformance event (e.g. <strong>GLASS_BREAK</strong>) and logs the error.</li>
  <li>Severity is automatically assessed; low-risk issues are logged, high-risk ones trigger an email to the <strong>Quality Lead</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Quality Lead evaluates the issue; critical items are escalated to the <strong>Corrective Action Agent</strong>.</li>
  <li>Corrective actions are created in the ERP (e.g. <strong>D365</strong>) and logged for follow-up.</li>
  <li>All actions and status updates are stored in a centralised tracking system for auditability and dashboard visibility.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Faster triage and resolution of critical equipment failures across the fab.</li>
  <li>Clear escalation workflows and role separation between detection, review, and corrective action.</li>
  <li>Real-time visibility through a centralised dashboard, enabling proactive quality management.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Automated ISO Certificate Validation</h3>

  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
  <p>
    Manual review of ISO certificates from manufacturers is slow, inconsistent, and prone to oversight, 
    especially when tracking duplicates, expired certificates, or pending renewals. If not mitigated, this poses risks to compliance and vendor management.
  </p>

  <h4>Solution</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use AI to analyse uploaded ISO certificates and automate the approval or rejection decision based on content and metadata.</li>
    <li>Perform database validation to check for duplicates and expiry before saving records.</li>
    <li>Implement daily expiry checks and send automated email reminders for expiring certificates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Process</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Manufacturer</strong> uploads an ISO certificate, which is received and analysed by the <strong>AI system</strong>.</li>
    <li>The system sends the parsed certificate to the <strong>Reviewing Authority</strong> for a manual decision.</li>
    <li>If approved, the certificate is checked for duplicates/expiry and saved to the database; else, a rejection email is sent to the <strong>Manufacturer</strong>.</li>
    <li>Daily system checks categorise ISO records as <strong>valid, expired, or expiring</strong>.</li>
    <li>Expiring certificates trigger email reminders to Manufacturers, prompting a re-evaluation process.</li>
  </ul> 

  <h4>Key Outcomes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Significant reduction in manual effort for ISO certificate validation and tracking.</li>
    <li>Improved compliance and vendor governance through proactive expiry alerts.</li>
    <li>Centralised document database with automated duplicate and validity checks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Maintenance Bot for Teams Integration</h3>

  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
  <p>
    Maintenance request handling in production environments is often fragmented, leading to duplicated reports, inconsistent cost tracking, and slow communication between workers, asset managers, and finance teams.
  </p>

  <h4>Solution</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deploy a Teams-integrated bot to capture and triage maintenance requests from production staff in real time.</li>
    <li>Automatically check for existing requests, assign escalation pathways, and route approvals to the correct asset manager.</li>
    <li>Incorporate live cost projection workflows with the finance team to validate and escalate requests as needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Process</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A production worker submits a maintenance request directly via the <strong>Teams bot</strong>.</li>
    <li>The bot checks for existing requests; if found, it informs the worker and shares the point of contact.</li>
    <li>If no existing request exists, a work order is generated and routed to the <strong>Asset Manager</strong> for approval.</li>
    <li>Upon approval, the system triggers a cost estimation via the <strong>Finance Agent</strong>.</li>
    <li>If cost is under threshold, the request is logged and confirmed; if over threshold, itâ€™s escalated to the <strong>Finance Team</strong> for review.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="project-media">
    <div class="bpmn">

      <img src="assets/images/project4_assets.jpg" alt="aintenance Bot in Teams Demo">
    </div>
  </div>

  <h4>Key Outcomes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced duplication of maintenance tickets and better tracking of existing issues.</li>
    <li>Faster routing and approval of maintenance work through integrated Teams communication.</li>
    <li>Improved coordination between asset managers and finance through real-time cost visibility and escalation paths.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>RAG Chatbot for Project Managers</h3>

  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
  <p>
    Project managers often struggle to quickly access reliable information across fragmented internal documents and evolving external sources, leading to delays in decision-making and duplicated research efforts.
  </p>

  <h4>Solution</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot tailored for project management queries.</li>
    <li>The chatbot first searches an internal knowledge base of current and past projects for relevant answers.</li>
    <li>If no relevant internal data is found, it automatically queries trusted web sources to provide an up-to-date response.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Process</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A project manager submits a question via the chatbot interface.</li>
    <li>The chatbot performs a semantic search over the internal project knowledge base using vector embeddings.</li>
    <li>If a relevant answer is found, it is returned immediately with source references.</li>
    <li>If no internal match exists, the chatbot performs a targeted web search and yields a response.</li>
    <li>The user can then decide whether to store this in the knowledge base or reject it.</li>
  </ul>

    <div class="bpmn">
      <img src="assets/images/project5_assets.jpg" alt="RAG Chatbot for Project Managers Workflow">
    </div>
  </div>

  <h4>Key Outcomes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Faster, more accurate access to project-specific knowledge for managers.</li>
    <li>Reduced reliance on manual digging through documentation or chasing updates from peers.</li>
    <li>Real-time fallback to web-based answers ensures up-to-date and complete guidance.</li>
